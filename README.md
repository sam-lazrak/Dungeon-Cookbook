# Practice is always worth it

> “_Every time you do a thing the easy wEay, it dulls your skill for doing it. Convenient and simple ain't the same. Doing things your way with magic is the same as buying veggies at the store._”

# Engaging interests help a feeling of belonging

> "You've been doing this all by yourself. Hasn't that been difficult?"
> 
> "_Nothing hard about it at all._"
>
> "_It's a thing I like doing._"
